Today topic is CI CD Pipeline

We can create pipeline job in two ways:
->	Pipeline code
->	Build pipeline.

Pipeline code: It uses Groovy language.
We need to write code in groovy language and in stages mode.

Exercise1:
Jenkins --> New item --> Select pipeline and name something as “pipelinejob2”

Build pipeline plugin
Step1:
Jenkins-->Manage Jenkins-->Manage Plugins-->
In filter section, search for “build pipeline” 
Select “Build Pipeline Plugin” 
Install without restart

Create multiple jobs (3 now) like as below

job1: echo "continuous integration getting done"
job2: echo "continuous delivery getting done"
job3: echo "continuous deployment getting done"

go to each job "Configure" --> Build Triggers --> Build after other projects are built -->

Configure each job should trigger one after another job, then run the job. 
It will run successfully all jobs.

If you forget the jenkins password, what to do?
go to '/var/lib/jenkins/' folder in RHEL machine
Then copy the jenkins folder to another RHEL machine
