Today topic is Jenkins.


Kohsuke Kawaguchi is a computer programmer who is best known as the creator of the Jenkins software project.

Jenkins is an Integration tool. 
Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery.

It's a java based application, to run this app you need to have JDK software install. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat.

It supports version control tools, including AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, TD/OMS, ClearCase and RTC, and can execute Apache Ant, Apache Maven and sbt based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.
 
Released under the MIT License, Jenkins is free software

The Jenkins project was originally named Hudson, and was renamed after a dispute with Oracle.

In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open-source automation server. Built with Java, it provides over 1000 plugins to support automating virtually anything, so that humans can actually spend their time doing things machines cannot.

Jenkins replaced Hudson since February 8, 2017 in Eclipse. In March 2018 Jenkins X software project for Kubernetes was publicly presented,[19] with support for different cloud provider including AWS EKS among others.

To install jenkins, we have add the package to repo and then install it.

wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo

rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key 
===========================
If you've previously imported the key from Jenkins, the "rpm --import" will fail because you already have a key. Please ignore that and move on.

You will need to explicitly install a Java runtime environment, because Oracle's Java RPMs are incorrect and fail to register as providing a java dependency. Thus, adding an explicit dependency requirement on Java would force installation of the OpenJDK JVM.
